/* TO DO LIST:
 * Make the enemy stats method work when called
 * Add more battles
 * introduce EXP system and Levels (allows the player to improve stats)
 * introduce types of enemies that makes the move you use actually matter instead of just picking the highest damage
 * introduce a crit system based off a luck stat
 * make more moves that you can unlock and swap out based off your level
 * Store system?
